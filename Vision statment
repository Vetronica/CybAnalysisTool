Vision Statement: Tool that can be used to analyze Cyber Secuirty assessment.  Analyzing a network, which has internet access somewhere.
The network will be modeled with MbSE, which is a format that can be made with software such as magic draw.
Using the modeled system, our program will analyze the network.  
The goal in this project is developing a cybersecurity planning for executing vulnerability assessment for operational environments, application of cybersecurity in operational environments and conducting decision analysis of crucial infrastructure by implementing model-based systems engineering.
